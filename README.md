# Overview

The networking program is written in Python using a standard library called socket. This program uses a client/ server network model. It requires the use of two separate files,
one is for the server side and the other is for the client side. In order to run this software two terminals will be used. First, the server side will be executed 
in the command prompt, then the client side will be executed in the same manner. A confirmation message will display, notifying the user that a connection to the
server has been established. 

The purpose for writing this software was to demonstrate how to create a client/ server network model in Python using a standard library. A TCP socket type was used
in this software.
