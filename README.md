# Overview

The networking program is written in Python using a standard library called socket. This program uses a client/ server network model. It requires the use of two separate files,
one is for the server side and the other is for the client side. In order to run this software two terminals will be used. First, the server side will be executed 
in the command prompt, then the client side will be executed in the same manner. A confirmation message will display, notifying the user that a connection to the
server has been established. 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
The purpose for writing this software was to demonstrate how to create a client/ server network model in Python using a standard library. A TCP socket type was used
in this software. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

The architecture used in this networking software is client/server. There is a file for both the server and client side.
The socket type that is used in this software is TCP. 

- TCP socket
- port number: 1243

{Identify the format of messages being sent between the client and server or the messages sent between two peers.}

# Development Environment
